## Project Overview

## Task 1: Data Exploration and Customer Analysis

- Explored and cleaned the dataset, formatting the Date column to the Date data type.
- Identified outliers using a box whisker plot.
- Developed metrics and examined sales drivers for overall sales performance insights.
- Created visualizations and formulated clear recommendations for the client's strategy.

**Insights:**

- Highest customer concentration in Mainstream-Young Single/Couples segment.
- Recommendation: Focus on TYRRELLS chips with increased visibility for Mainstream-young single/couples.

## Task 2: Experimentation and Uplift Testing

- Created measures to identify controlled stores against each trial store based on sales revenue and number of customers.
- Ranked potential controlled stores using Pearson Correlation and Magnitude distance.
- Assessed performance by comparing sales and customer trends of trial stores against control stores.

**Insights:**
- Control stores for trials 77, 86, and 88 are 233, 155, and 237 respectively.
- Store 77 and 88 show significant differences in at least two of the three months.

## Task 3: Analytics and Commercial Application

- Created a PowerPoint presentation using the Pyramid Principle to share key insights with the client.
- Submitted a report incorporating data visualizations, insights, and recommendations.
