## Project Overview
This project involves comprises of 3 tasks. And a comprehensive analysis of customer data and experimentation to provide actionable insights and recommendations for optimizing sales strategies.

## Task 1: Data Exploration and Customer Analysis

- Analyze transaction and customer data to identify trends and inconsistencies. Create metrics to gain insights into overall sales performance and create visualizations and prepare findings to formulate a clear recommendation for the client's strategy.

## Task 2: Experimentation and Uplift Testing

- Creating measures to identify controlled stores against trial stores to test the trial store sales performance.

## Task 3: Analytics and Commercial Application

- Create a report for the Client, highlighting key insights from Task 1 and Task 2 using the Pyramid Principle.

## Tools
- Excel, Rstudio (for Analysis).
- - Libraries used (in R)
  - library(ggplot2)
  - library(tidyr)
  - library(data.table)
  - library(tidyverse)
  - library(readr)
  - library(skimr)
  - library(janitor)
  - library(data.table)
- PowerPoint (for creating final report).

## Task 1: Data Exploration and Customer Analysis

- Explored and cleaned the dataset, formatting the Date column to the Date data type.
- Identified outliers using a box whisker plot.
- Developed metrics and examined sales drivers for overall sales performance insights.
- Created visualizations and formulated clear recommendations for the client's strategy.

**Insights:**
- Majority of sales come from Budget-Mid-age singles/couples, followed by Mainstream-young singles/couples.
- Highest customer concentration in the Mainstream-Young Single/Couples segment.
- Recommendation: Focus on TYRRELLS chips with increased visibility for Mainstream-young single/couples.

## Task 2: Experimentation and Uplift Testing

- Created measures to identify controlled stores against each trial store based on sales revenue and number of customers.
- Ranked potential controlled stores using Pearson Correlation and Magnitude distance.
- Assessed performance by comparing sales and customer trends of trial stores against control stores.

**Insights:**
- Control stores for trials 77, 86, and 88 are 233, 155, and 237 respectively.
- Stores 77 and 88 show significant differences in at least two of the three months.

## Task 3: Analytics and Commercial Application

- Created a PowerPoint presentation using the Pyramid Principle to share key insights with the client.
- Submitted a report incorporating data visualizations, insights, and recommendations.

## Feedback and Reflection

I greatly value the feedback received throughout the internship.
